# Capstone Project Report: Boba Bao
**Author:** Austin Tao  
**Date:** January 2nd, 2021

## Introduction/Business Problem
Bubble Tea (also known as "boba", "boba tea", "pearl milk tea") is a popular tea drink with tapioca that has quickly become a major trend in the food and beverage industry. Large portions of the US market are based in metropolitan areas on both the east and west coasts; in the Cupertino Village located directly across from Apple Park, no fewer than 5 bubble tea stores adjorn the plaza! It is clear that this market is competitive, both between different bubble tea stores and with other cafes and beverage chains such as Starbucks and Dunkin'.  
  
This leads to the following business problem: **If you are a businessperson looking to start a new bubble tea store in the Silicon Valley area, where would you plan to locate your store?** 

## Data
The data that will be worked with will be a combination of Foursquare location data and data from the `bayarea_boba_spots.csv` available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vnxiclaire/bobabayarea). The csv file will primarily be used to compare between two boba shops, while Foursquare location data will be used to assess generalized venues in areas (i.e. businesses outside of the bubble tea sector). **In short, Foursquare will be used to analyze generalized location data while the aforementioned csv file will be used solely to compare bubble tea data.**
